        <h1>The Punic Wars</h1> <br/>
        
        
        <p>The Punic Wars, which were 3 wars that were fought between Rome and Carthage. These wars spanned 264BC to 146BC. 
        </p> </br>
        
        <h2>First Punic War</h2>
        <p> The first Carthage Vs. Rome war was between the years 264BC-241BC. It happend due to a crisis in a small island 
        in the middle between Italy and Sicily. In which a band of mercinaies had some-what taken over the town and was being pressed by
        King Hieron the II of Syracuse. Carthage sent their troops in first, but the Romans were not far behind. The roman army was able to 
        take care of the carthagian army easily. This started the first Punic war. </p>
        
        <h3> Second Punic War </h3>
        <p>Due to romans army which was superior at the time, this sounded like the romans could chose where they would be able to fight
        their battles. They sent one army towards spain and another to africa. A guy named Hannibal was a general from carlage, he came up with the
        plan to cut off roman supplies by carrying the war to Itlay. After a long journey through spain, Gaul, and over the alps, he finally made it into
        Italy. He arrived into northern italy in 218 with 20,000 infantry and 6,000 horses that were of a spanish or African breeds.<br/>
