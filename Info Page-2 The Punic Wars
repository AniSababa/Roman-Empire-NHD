        <h2>First Punic War</h2>
        <p> The first Carthage Vs. Rome war was between the years 264BC-241BC. It happend due to a crisis in a small island 
        in the middle between Italy and Sicily. In which a band of mercinaies had some-what taken over the town and was being pressed by
        King Hieron the II of Syracuse. Carthage sent their troops in first, but the Romans were not far behind. The roman army was able to 
        take care of the carthagian army easily. This started the first Punic war. </p>
