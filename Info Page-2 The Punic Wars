        <h1>The Punic Wars</h1> <br/>
        
        
        <p>The Punic Wars, which were 3 wars that were fought between Rome and Carthage. These wars spanned 264BC to 146BC. 
        </p> </br>
        
        <h2>First Punic War</h2>
        <p> The first Carthage Vs. Rome war was between the years 264BC-241BC. It happend due to a crisis in a small island 
        in the middle between Italy and Sicily. In which a band of mercinaies had some-what taken over the town and was being pressed by
        King Hieron the II of Syracuse. Carthage sent their troops in first, but the Romans were not far behind. The roman army was able to 
        take care of the carthagian army easily. This started the first Punic war. </p>
        
        <h3> Second Punic War </h3>
        <p>Due to romans army which was superior at the time, this sounded like the romans could chose where they would be able to fight
        their battles. They sent one army towards spain and another to africa. A guy named Hannibal was a general from carlage, he came up with the
        plan to cut off roman supplies by carrying the war to Itlay. After a long journey through spain, Gaul, and over the alps, he finally made it into
        Italy. He arrived into northern italy in 218 with 20,000 infantry and 6,000 horses that were of a spanish or African breeds.<br/>

<p>Hannibal advanced through Italy, at the end of the year the Roman Army already had reinforcements from the siclian legion and led a battle
on the banks Trebbia river. Due to Hannibals smart milliteristic tactics he was able to defeat the Roman army and make the northern part
of Italy secure of Roman Rule. In 217 the Carhagian army, lead by mostly gauls traped Roman General, Gaius Flaminius, at lake trasimene
.The total lose of roman troops was roughly 15,000. Due to the fact that he would not attack the capital until his force was a bit bigger 
he started to march to the south of the Italian pennisula. Although the conquest was all around the roman citizens were not as fast to join the 
Carthage men. A new military leader was aponted and his name was, Quintus Fabius Maxiumus Verrucosus. He was later nicknamed "Cuncator"
He is known for creating the "fabian strategy". The "fabian strategy" is where Fabius would dog the Carthage army in which it would prevent the
Carthagian army from creating a permanant camp. 
In 216 an battle accured where Rome sent in 85,000 men to battle to kill the Carthagian army. It was a utter failure. The Carthiagian army
went and did a very early version of blitzkrieg. </P>
