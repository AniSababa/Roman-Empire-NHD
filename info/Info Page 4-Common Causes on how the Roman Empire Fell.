         <h1>Common Causes on how the Roman Empire Fell.</h1>
         <p>When a Empire so big and powerfull sundely falls, it is not becasue of one reason only. It could be many factors all adding
         up into the fall of the most influencal empire ever in the world. </p> <br/>
         <ul> <br/>
         <li> Public Health- The roman empire made many invastments in Public Health. The rich people had water, pumped from aqueducts,
         through lead pipes and it was then when the water  reached the house. Now in our modern time we now know that lead can be a deadly
         metal or substance. They still belived in that time that the water was purified in those lead pipes. Although the rich had access to this 
         way of life, the amount of dealth in the rich class was very high.</li> <br/>
         <li>Unemployment- Towards the end of the course of the roman empire, the farms were moved to larger estates. These estates were owned by the rich 
         and worked by the poor. It was for the rich people a feeling of "eat, drink and be merry," the reap of the crop was nothing close to a big 
         business disision. With the cost of paying your slaves the prices on those goods went up. Since there were lower prices out there, the 
         farmers could not lower their prices on their products for fear they might not make a profit. This led to some of these farmers losing or selling
         their farm, this lead to a crowding of unemployed people to happen. At one time one Roman Ruler, it is said, fead 100,000 people in Rome alone. This
         also lead to a increased crime rate.</li> <br/>
         <li>Inflation- This problem started comming on the scene after the rule of Marcus Aurelius. Due to the fact that the Romans 
         stopped conquering lands the Gold production rate dropped. The gold storage was becoming less and less. The roman coin dropped in value
         soon after this. At this point the merchants raised there prices. The people though started to barter for what they needed, by using 
         food and/or clothing. Fruit and vegitables were used to pay taxes.</li> <br/>
         <li>Increased Military spending</li> <br/>
         <li>Inferior Technology</li> <br/>
